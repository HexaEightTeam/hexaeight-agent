"""
Create JWT files for all critical DLLs and deploy them to the package directory

This script:
1. Creates JWTs for all 3 critical DLLs (HexaEightAgent, HexaEightJWTLibrary, HexaEightASKClientLibrary)
2. Copies the JWT files to the hexaeight_agent package directory
3. Verifies the deployment worked correctly

Usage:
    cd /home/ubuntu/signature-license
    source /home/ubuntu/agent/workdir/agent_env/bin/activate
    python3 /home/ubuntu/hexaeight-agent/tests/create_and_deploy_dll_jwts.py
